<h3 class="section-heading"><div align=center>SMUG: Towards Robust MRI Reconstruction by Smoothed Unrolling</div></h3>

<p>Although deep learning (DL) has gained much popularity for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), recent studies have shown that DL-based MRI reconstruction models could be over-sensitive to  tiny input perturbations (that are called `adversarial perturbations'), which cause unstable, low-quality reconstructed images. 
    This raises the question of how to design robust DL methods for  MRI reconstruction. 
    To address this problem, we propose  a novel image reconstruction framework, termed Smoothed  Unrolling (SMUG), which advances a deep unrolling-based MRI reconstruction model using a randomized smoothing (RS)-based robust learning operation. RS, which improves the tolerance of a model against input noises, has been widely used in the design of adversarial defense for image classification. Yet, we find that  the conventional design that applies RS to  the entire DL process is ineffective for  MRI reconstruction. We show that SMUG addresses the above issue by customizing the RS operation based on the unrolling  architecture  of the DL-based MRI reconstruction model. Compared to   the vanilla RS approach and several variants of SMUG,  we show that 
    SMUG improves the robustness of MRI reconstruction with respect to a diverse set of  perturbation sources, including perturbations to input measurements, different measurement sampling rates, and different unrolling steps.

<p>Recent medical image reconstruction techniques focus on generating high-quality medical images
    suitable for clinical use at the lowest possible cost and
    with the fewest possible adverse effects on patients. Recent
    works have shown significant promise for reconstructing
    MR images from sparsely sampled k-space data using deep
    learning. In this work, we propose a technique that rapidly
    estimates deep neural networks directly at reconstruction
    time by fitting them on small adaptively estimated neighborhoods of a training set. In brief, our algorithm alternates
    between searching for neighbors in a data set that are similar to the test reconstruction, and training a local network
    on these neighbors followed by updating the test reconstruction. Because our reconstruction model is learned on
    a dataset that is structurally similar to the image being reconstructed rather than being fit on a large, diverse training
    set, it is more adaptive to new scans. It can also handle
    changes in training sets and flexible scan settings, while
    being relatively fast. Our approach, dubbed LONDN-MRI,
    was validated on the FastMRI multi-coil knee data set using
    deep unrolled reconstruction networks. Reconstructions
    were performed at four fold and eight fold undersampling
    of k-space with 1D variable-density random phase-encode
    undersampling masks. Our results demonstrate that our
    proposed locally-trained method produces higher-quality
    reconstructions compared to models trained globally on
    larger datasets.</p>
