<p>Compressed sensing (CS) has been popular in magnetic resonance
    imaging (MRI) and accelerates the measurement acquisition process
    by undersampling data in k-space, while exploiting sparsity and incoherence
    to achieve accurate reconstructions. Deep learning methods
    have recently demonstrated superior performance for MRI reconstruction
    from undersampled data. However, most of the methods
    rely on complex models to achieve promising results via deterministic
    optimization. Alternatively, very recent works utilize deep reinforcement
    learning (DRL) to restore high-quality images, where
    a policy is learned to select appropriate actions or tools to progressively
    refine corrupted images with a simple network model. However,
    the model capability of DRL-based approaches is, to some extent,
    limited due to its finite action space. Moreover, most of these
    DRL methods are physics-free, while it is well-known that the prior
    concerning the physical forward model is extremely crucial for solving
    ill-posed inverse problems such as in CS-MRI. Motivated by
    these challenges, we propose a novel DRL-based unrolling framework
    by integrating model priors into the intrinsic iterative process
    of DRL strategy for MRI reconstruction. Thus, the capability of the
    DRL model is significantly enhanced by exploiting the merits of
    the unrolling scheme with almost no additional computational cost.
    Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DRL-based
    unrolling framework achieves superior MRI reconstruction performance
    compared with the previous baselines.
