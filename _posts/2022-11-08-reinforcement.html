<h3><strong><div align=center>Revolutionizing MRI with Compressed Sensing</div></strong></h3>

<br>

    <p><strong>What is Compressed Sensing (CS)?</strong></p>
    <p>- A game-changer in MRI.</p>
    <p>- Accelerates measurements by collecting less data, but smartly.</p>
    <p>- Utilizes the power of sparsity and incoherence for accurate image reconstruction.</p>

    <br>
    
    <p><strong>Deep Learning to the Rescue</strong></p>
    <p>- Recent advancements have leaned on deep learning for improved MRI reconstructions.</p>
    <p>- Many methods use intricate models and deterministic optimization for promising outcomes.</p>
    
    <br>

    <p><strong>Enter Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)</strong></p>
    <p>- The latest trend: using DRL for high-quality image restoration.</p>
    <p>- The approach? Train a policy to select the best tools and progressively refine images.</p>
    <p>- A limitation? Their finite action space restricts DRL capabilities.</p>
    <p>- Another concern? Many DRL methods don't incorporate essential physics principles.</p>

    <br>
    
    <p><strong>Our Cutting-edge Solution</strong></p>
    <p>- We've developed a novel DRL-based framework that combines best practices.</p>
    <p>- How? By integrating model priors into DRL's iterative process.</p>
    <p>- The result? A dramatically improved DRL model without added computational demands.</p>

    <br>
    
    <p><strong>Proven Results</strong></p>
    <p>- Our new DRL framework outperforms previous methods, delivering exceptional MRI reconstruction.</p>

    <br>
    
    <p><strong>Why This Matters</strong></p>
    <p>- Faster, accurate, and efficient MRI scans can revolutionize medical diagnostics.</p>
    <p>- Embracing deep learning can lead to groundbreaking advancements in healthcare.</p>
