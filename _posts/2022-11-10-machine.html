<h2><div align=center>Optimized Parallel Combination of Deep Networks and Sparsity Regularization for MR Image Reconstruction (OPCoNS)</div></h2>

<h3 class="section-heading">Abstract</h3>

<p>This work examines optimized parallel combinations of deep networks and conventional regularized reconstruction for improved quality of MR image reconstructions from undersampled k-space data. Features learned by deep networks and typical model-based iterative algorithms (e.g., sparsity-penalized reconstruction) could complement each other for effective reconstructions. We observe that combining the image features from multiple approaches in a parallel fashion with appropriate learned weights leads to more effective image representations that are not captured by either strictly supervised or (unsupervised) conventional iterative methods. </p>

<p>Recent medical image reconstruction techniques focus on generating high-quality medical images
    suitable for clinical use at the lowest possible cost and
    with the fewest possible adverse effects on patients. Recent
    works have shown significant promise for reconstructing
    MR images from sparsely sampled k-space data using deep
    learning. In this work, we propose a technique that rapidly
    estimates deep neural networks directly at reconstruction
    time by fitting them on small adaptively estimated neighborhoods of a training set. In brief, our algorithm alternates
    between searching for neighbors in a data set that are similar to the test reconstruction, and training a local network
    on these neighbors followed by updating the test reconstruction. Because our reconstruction model is learned on
    a dataset that is structurally similar to the image being reconstructed rather than being fit on a large, diverse training
    set, it is more adaptive to new scans. It can also handle
    changes in training sets and flexible scan settings, while
    being relatively fast. Our approach, dubbed LONDN-MRI,
    was validated on the FastMRI multi-coil knee data set using
    deep unrolled reconstruction networks. Reconstructions
    were performed at four fold and eight fold undersampling
    of k-space with 1D variable-density random phase-encode
    undersampling masks. Our results demonstrate that our
    proposed locally-trained method produces higher-quality
    reconstructions compared to models trained globally on
    larger datasets.</p>
