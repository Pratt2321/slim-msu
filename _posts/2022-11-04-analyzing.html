    <p>This study explores the effects of mantra meditation on cognitive abilities, shedding light on its potential therapeutic value for mental health. By examining a less-explored form of meditation, we aim to provide an alternative non-pharmacological approach that improves attentional focus.</p>

    <p>Specifically, P300 (a widely used measurement to reflect the cognitive process) results were collected by iCognative technology (made by Brainwave Science, Inc.) on a total of twenty-three pre-screened participants. The mantra-based meditation (MBM) group (nmale = 10, nfemale = 2, median age or Mage  = 31.5 years, SD =  3.9 years) comprised individuals who had undergone over 2 years of practice, mainly chanting the “Hare Krishna'' mantra. For purposes of comparison, a novice group (nmale = 8, nfemale = 3, Mage =  23 years, SD = 5.7 years), who had no experience with meditation, was included.</p>

    <p>The P300 speller test is conducted by presenting a grid of characters on a computer screen to the participant. The characters are flashed in a random order, and the participant is instructed to count instances of a specific target character. In the test, EEG data are divided into epochs — time segments corresponding to the presentation of each character. The epochs are then averaged across multiple trials to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Results</h3>

<p>The empirical findings revealed a substantial reduction in latency for the MBM group (Mlatency = 366.4 ms, SD = 17.48 ms) compared to the novice group (Mlatency = 414.15 ms, SD = 23.84 ms) (fig. 1). An unpaired t-test demonstrated a significant between-group difference, affirming the distinct impact of mantra-based meditation on latency during the P300 test (p-value = 0.0022). Based on our observations, the MBM group showed superior sustained attention and task engagement compared to novices, as evidenced by their enhanced accuracy in counting letter flashes during the task.</p>
